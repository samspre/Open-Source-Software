##### Why it is important to choose a LICENSE?

Licenses protect your intellectual property, as well as market a specific brand or franchise.  Licenses also allow the redistribution of any software, and depending on what kind of software (free, copyright, etc), can impose restrictions on how it can be modified.  In addition, certain licenses can also assure the "legitimacy" of a piece of software, such as the Microsoft Office package you're buying is the legitimate one.

##### Why is it important that you SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?

Based off aforementioned reasons, using a project without an explicit license can harm your computer (if illegitimate) or can get you in trouble for copyright infringement, etc.

##### Do you agree with the Failure to follow the Open System Model claim?

I agree with the claim "'the right thing' design approach, tends to lose to 'worse is better'", and that Gopher failed in following the Open System Model.  Gopher followed the former, putting "too much burden on themselves for providing innovations to the protocol, servers software, etc. They decided that they would decide what the "right thing" was, instead of unleashing these decisions on others."  They also "forked" their project too early into development, causing them to lose a lot of support for itself (the parent platform), which caused the children to "die out" as well.  These companies all soon fell (including Gopher), simply because Gopher failed to follow the Open System Model.

##### Can you justify why such a license is chosen based on the history, goals and philosophy of the project?

Linux uses the GPL v2 license, which allows it to "make the originating source code (and any modifications) available to the recipient" (1). They most likely chose this license because they wanted to run Linux under an open source license that followed the 4 philosophies.  Linux describes itself as "an operating system that is 'by the people, for the people'" (2), so the GPL v2 license is the perfect choice for it.
