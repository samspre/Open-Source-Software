Why it is important to choose a LICENSE?

Why is it important that you SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?

Read the Failure to follow the Open System Model Section of Why the Web beat Gopher.

Can you justify why such a license is chosen based on the history, goals and philosophy of the project? (Justification for ONE choice is enough, but be specific and make sure you provide references to articles or web resources).
