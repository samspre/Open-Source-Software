##### Why it is important to choose a LICENSE?

Licenses protect your intellectual property, as well as market a specific brand or franchise.  Licenses also allow the redistribution of any software, and depending on what kind of software (free, copyright, etc), can impose restrictions on how it can be modified.  In addition, certain licenses can also assure the "legitimacy" of a piece of software, such as the Microsoft Office package you're buying is the legitimate one.

##### Why is it important that you SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?

Based off aforementioned reasons, using a project without an explicit license can harm your computer (if illegitimate) or can get you in trouble for copyright infringement, etc.

##### Do you agree with the Failure to follow the Open System Model claim?

##### Can you justify why such a license is chosen based on the history, goals and philosophy of the project?

Linux uses the GPL v2 license, which allows it to "make the originating source code (and any modifications) available to the recipient" (1). They most likely chose this license because they wanted to run Linux under an open source license that followed the 4 philosophies.  Linux describes itself as "an operating system that is 'by the people, for the people'" (2), so the GPL v2 license is the perfect choice for it.
