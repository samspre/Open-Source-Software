## Reading Responses

### How to Answer Questions in a Helpful Way

From my experience, you can also use a calm, level voice and don't take bias regarding their code.  For example, if you see a piece of bad code, but it still does the job decently, don't berate them for it unless it is relevant to the question and/or it is a glaring issue that needs to be fixed ASAP; it might distract them or make them feel worse for not having another piece of working code.

In addition, you can give them sources or more information on how you got to your answer so they can either learn more or look back on it if necessary.
